# Living a Good Life

# Two problems in one

The question of how to live a good life is a complex one. It is a hard problem to build universal consensus on what qualifies as a good life. After all, it is a richly discussed topic in human history. Setting that aside for a moment, some definition of a good life is a prerequisite to design a process to achieve it. In this sense, there are two separate topics to contend with, each being perpetually open for discussion and analysis:
- the definition of a good life
- the process to live the specified good life

The first point here is a deeply philosophical concept, with a rich history of interpretations.
